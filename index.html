                    David Lynch — the filmmaker, painter, sound artist, and writer — is my favorite artist. He is one of the few artists I’ve followed who can work convincingly across various mediums, which is what I aspire to do as well. I discovered Lynch in 11th grade when I stumbled across “Twin Peaks” on Netflix. By episode 5 of the first season, I was fully immersed in his and Mark Frost’s world; the offbeat writing, Angelo Badalamenti’s soundtrack, the art direction and production design, and the sound design (orchestrated by Lynch himself) left an indelible mark on my own approach to art creation. I eventually made my way through the rest of Lynch’s work and discovered that he not only leads his productions as a director, but is also the director of sound design on all of his projects — in fact, he reportedly begins his creative process with sound design as the foundation. Lynch’s work taught me that you can effectively translate raw emotion, feeling, and spirit into immersive and complex art, while cultivating distinct visual language — and the soundtrack is key to immersion. Twin Peaks: The Return (2017) and Mulholland Drive (2004) are tied as my favorite works by Lynch.
